Upon launching the voider, a "void" folder will be created, and a 0.txt file inside of it
The cursor will blink, awaiting for you to input a line
Press Space to send line into the void and into 0txt
Press Enter or scroll down to fetch a random line
Txt files in the void folder are monitored for changes so if you add txt files the lines in it will be fetched 
If fetching lines fails, wait for indexing to complete
Use Down to decrease opacity and Up to increase it
Input 0 followed by a name to move 0.txt contents to newly created file with that name
For example, if you input 0something the content from 0.txt will move to a new file named something.txt
If you input 0 it create a new file with random name and move content from 0.txt into it
Backspace or Alt+f4 will close the program
